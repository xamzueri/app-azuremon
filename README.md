This is a demo application on how to use Xamarin.Forms with Azure's Mobile App Service.

* Offline Sync
* Easy Tables
* SSO (Microsoft Account, Facebook, Google, Twitter)


## Mock data

The app also has a very small set of mock data if you don't want to use an Azure App Service Mobile Backend.

## Build your own Backend

This repo contains a full backend that you can deploy to your own Azure App Service Mobile App Backend.
